# Version Numbering 

Due to our desire to frequently update this resource, we will implement a version numbering system to ensure that users are made aware of when changes are being made and how these changes may affect them. It is therefore advised that individuals keep track of which version of the GPAD cards they are using for their project. 

We use a A.B.C version numbering system:

A. Major releases that will coincide with the addition of a significant volume of datasets to the library (likely to coincide with the publication of a paper). A major release may also be deemed necessary if there is a substantial change to the operation of the dashboard. 

B. Minor releases will coincide with the addition of a small number of new datasets to the library. It is planned that minor releases will not be more frequent that once per month. 

C. Patch releases will coincide with changes to the data that is currently stored within the repository. These will also be used to address bug fixes or minor amendments to code.
